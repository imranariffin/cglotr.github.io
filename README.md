# Blog-aware Portfolio
Add new stuff to your online portfolio without writing any HTML & CSS!

## Fork me and easily make a portfolio of your own
- Fork this repo.
- Change the repo name to `<your_github_account_name>.github.io`.
- Update `_config.yml` to fit your info.
- Add your stuff into `_projects`, `_social`, and `timeline`.
- Push to GitHub and see your website at `https://<your_github_account_name>.github.io/`.

## What is happening in the background?
- When you push any changes to your remote, GitHub will try to build the files since it knows that
  they are all Jekyll files.
- If the build is successful GitHub will host your generated files at
  `https://<your_github_account_name>.github.io/`.
